# You Need A Timetable

This is a time management app based on the principles of YNAB (You Need A Budget): www.youneedabudget.com

1. Give every hour a job.
2. Save for a busy day.
3. Roll with the punches.
4. Live on last week's time.

Here's how it will work.

Next week, I have 168 hours to spend.  I can divide them as I choose between work, sleep, domestic chores, hobbies, side projects - whatever I want.  I budget my time for the same reason I budget my money - because I want to be in control of how I spend it.

A big project is a debt.  When I commit to a 4-week project that will take (say) 50 hours of my time, I have taken on 50 hours of debt, together with a goal to pay off that debt in 28 days time.  To do this, I will need to spend about 1.8 hours a day on it.  If I spend more than that, it will be paid off (completed) sooner.  If I spend less, my later payments will be larger - I will have to do a last-minute rush.

I also have regular expenses - 8 hours of sleep, 2 hours for meals, 1 hour for commuting, 30 minutes for email, every day.

And I have fun stuff I want to do - watching movies, reading.

I set goals: pay off this debt (finish this project) by this date, do 30 minutes of exercise a day.  I then plan how I am going to spend 168 hours, and I budget every one of them.  I then record how I spend my time during the day, and record those in the apps as transactions.

Every day, I get 24 hours of income to budget.  I also need to check my estimates of how much time a project will take, and update them as the project progresses.

## Secondary Purpose

The secondary purpose of this project is also to allow me to learn a set of technologies that are new to me:
* BDD
* NodeJS
* SailsJS
* d3.js
